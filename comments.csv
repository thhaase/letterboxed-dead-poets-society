"1","roobyboobyr2d2","One of the best movies I’ve watched in a longtime. First of all could be considered slow paced but bring back long movies that male you feel the story, they don’t make movies like this anymore. I miss old films like this one, where the character’s personality’s weren’t said so loudly or forced on the audience, small actions the characters do can you make you understand their characters. Nowadays everything’s always spoken which makes you feel the acting, the quirky…","2026-02-25",5

"13","Brayan22","O Captain, my Captain.It’s almost a crime to call Mr. Keating just a teacher — he was far more than that. Through the way he treated those boys, he showed what poetry truly is: love, freedom, and the courage to think for yourself. This film is a powerful reminder to all of us to listen to our inner voice and pursue what we truly long for, even when the world tries to silence it. Fiquei muito emocionado na ultima cena.CARPE DIEM.","2026-02-24",5

"15","xyrill","Dead Poets Society isn’t just a film—it feels like a wake-up call. It reminds us what it truly means to live. “carpe diem” — seize the day — isn’t just a poetic line in the movie; it becomes a challenge. a challenge to make something of our lives now, instead of waiting for the “right” time. the film captures the beauty and weight of being alive — to fear, to rejoice, to grieve, to try, to fail, to lose, and…","2025-10-24",5

Reminds me of how I felt after reading a certain scene in the book Where The Red Fern Grows that really stuck with me and lives in my memory as one of my favorite pieces of literature. The final act of this movie is Incredible and It’s topped off with the great Robin Williams, may he rest in peace, who delivers another amazing performance, quickly climbing the ranks as one of my favorite actors. A truly great film. God Bless y’all :)","2026-02-24",5

Whenever Robin Williams isn't there my interest waned. I've seen better movies about teachers. As far as Peter Weir movies go, The Truman Show is far superior.

"919","dario050","Il professor Keating incoraggia tutti a cogliere ogni opportunità prima che sia troppo tardi e liberarsi dal conformismo, invitandoci a ragionare autonomamente sulle nostre scelte di vita e non agire per essere accettati. Il messaggio é quello di vivere con passione, ricercando l'autenticità proprio come i poeti estinti. Mi ha colpito una frase molto toccante che racchiude il significato del film:""Andai nei boschi perché volevo vivere con saggezza e in profondità, e succhiare tutto il midollo della vita, sbaragliare tutto ciò che non era vita e non scoprire in punto di morte che non ero vissuto"".","2026-01-26",4.5

The friendships between the lads feel so authentic and the way they grow as people under the Carpe Diem motto is inspiring. The final 30 minutes are utterly heartbreaking and hit with such emotional weight. This is a beautiful film, but fuck that Cameron kid, ginger prat.","2026-02-20",5

The colors are often sober and a little dark, which creates a serious atmosphere, but there are also brighter moments that give hope and freedom, I love this movie even if I cry every time.","2026-02-23",5

Ces derniers sont alors l’image de ce qu’est la jeunesse inspirée d’espoir et d’ambition. Un message fort qui s’adresse au spectateur dans une certaine indélicatesse narrative.

Robin Williams delivers a heartfelt performance that brings warmth and depth to the character of Mr. Keating. However, while its message is powerful and emotional, some parts of the plot feel predictable, which keeps it from earning an even higher score. Also, the beginning was in slow and not very enjoyable, but the ending was powerful which is why I rated it higher.","2026-02-23",3.5

Конечно, хочется отметить прекрасную актерскую игру, эмоциональные сцены, и правда, на высоте. Это замечательное кино, но для шедевра он довольно предсказуем и, по-американски прост, что-ли.
